                <p>I'm in my junior year at Drexel University as a graphic design major in 
                    the Westphal College of Media Arts & Design. I'm coding this website with HTML, 
                    CSS, and a smidge of JS for my Motion I class. I'm definitley pushing myself out 
                    of my design comfort zone!</p>
